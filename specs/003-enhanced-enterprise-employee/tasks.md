## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T006) before all other phases
- Contract tests (T007-T013) before any Microsoft Graph implementation
- Integration tests (T014-T018) before business logic implementation
- Authentication (T019-T022) blocks all enterprise features
- Microsoft Graph integration (T023-T026) blocks SharePoint operations
- Enhanced data models (T027-T030) before announcement enhancements

### Component Dependencies
- T031 (enhanced AnnouncementTool) depends on T027-T030 (data models)
- T032-T035 (announcement features) depend on T024 (SharePoint service)
- T036-T039 (approval components) depend on T025 (user service) and T028 (approval types)
- T040-T043 (SharePoint integration) depend on T023-T024 (Graph services)
- T044-T047 (audit features) depend on T026 (audit service)

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Preserve ALL existing Policy Update business logic in T031-T032
- Verify all tests fail before implementing corresponding features
- Each Microsoft Graph integration must include proper error handling
- All new components must maintain constitutional accessibility requirements
- Security and audit logging is mandatory for all enterprise operations
- SharePoint operations must respect existing permissions and organizational hierarchy
