# Feature Specification: Enhanced Enterprise Employee Announcement Tool

**Feature Branch**: `003-enhanced-enterprise-employee`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an enhanced version of the Employee Announcement Tool that preserves all existing business logic but incorporates the corporate controls from corporate-controls.md. Specifically: PRESERVE: - Policy Update workflow requiring Policy Name and Effective Date - All communication types (Policy Update, Company News, Team Announcement, Benefits Update) - Dynamic form fields based on communication type - Real-time preview functionality - Tone selection and formatting ADD ENTERPRISE CONTROLS: - Active Directory authentication with role-based access - Management approval workflows for Policy Updates - Complete audit logging for all user actions - Data retention and compliance features - Security controls and testing requirements Generate specifications that show exactly how to transform the prototype into an enterprise-ready application."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
HR administrators and managers need to create, approve, and send professional announcements to employees while maintaining full enterprise compliance, audit trails, and security controls. The system must preserve all existing announcement capabilities while adding enterprise governance layers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an HR administrator authenticates via Active Directory, **When** they access the announcement tool, **Then** they see only features permitted by their role-based permissions
2. **Given** an HR administrator creates a Policy Update announcement, **When** they submit it, **Then** the system routes it to designated managers for approval before distribution
3. **Given** a manager receives an approval request, **When** they review and approve a policy announcement, **Then** the system logs the approval decision and proceeds with email distribution
4. **Given** any user performs any action in the system, **When** the action completes, **Then** a complete audit record is created in the central enterprise audit system
5. **Given** an HR administrator creates any announcement type, **When** they use the real-time preview, **Then** the preview maintains all existing tone formatting and styling capabilities
6. **Given** an HR administrator selects different communication types, **When** the form updates, **Then** all existing dynamic field requirements are preserved (Policy Name/Effective Date for Policy Updates, etc.)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Active Directory authentication fails or is unavailable?
- How does the system handle approval workflow failures or unreachable approvers?
- What occurs when audit logging systems are temporarily unavailable?
- How are incomplete announcements handled during system maintenance windows?
- What happens when enterprise data storage systems are temporarily inaccessible?
