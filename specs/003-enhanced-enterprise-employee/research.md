# Research: Enhanced Enterprise Employee Announcement Tool

## Microsoft 365 Integration Architecture

### Decision: Microsoft Graph SDK with MSAL Authentication
**Rationale**: Microsoft Graph SDK provides comprehensive TypeScript support and handles authentication, rate limiting, and error handling automatically. MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) ensures secure, standards-compliant authentication with Microsoft 365.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Custom REST API calls to Microsoft Graph (rejected - lacks SDK benefits)
- SharePoint Framework (SPFx) approach (considered but frontend-first approach chosen for flexibility)
- Azure Functions backend (rejected - unnecessary complexity when Graph API suffices)

## Data Storage Strategy

### Decision: SharePoint Lists with Microsoft Graph API Access
**Rationale**: SharePoint Lists provide enterprise-grade storage with built-in versioning, permissions, audit trails, and backup capabilities. Microsoft Graph API enables modern REST access to SharePoint data with TypeScript support.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Azure SQL Database (rejected - overkill for announcement data)
- Azure Table Storage (rejected - lacks built-in audit capabilities)
- Microsoft Dataverse (considered but SharePoint simpler for this use case)

## Authentication & Authorization

### Decision: MSAL-React with Azure Active Directory Integration
**Rationale**: MSAL-React provides React hooks and components for seamless Azure AD integration. Built-in support for token refresh, silent authentication, and role-based access control.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom Azure AD integration (rejected - MSAL is Microsoft's recommended approach)
- Third-party authentication (rejected - enterprise requires Azure AD)
- Certificate-based authentication (rejected - user authentication not service authentication)

## Approval Workflow Implementation

### Decision: Power Automate Integration with SharePoint Triggers
**Rationale**: Power Automate provides enterprise workflow capabilities with SharePoint integration. Triggers on SharePoint list changes enable automatic approval routing with email notifications.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom workflow engine (rejected - significant development overhead)
- Microsoft Teams workflow apps (considered but Power Automate more flexible)
- Azure Logic Apps (rejected - Power Automate better integrated with Microsoft 365)

## Component Migration Strategy

### Decision: Incremental Enhancement of Existing Components
**Rationale**: Preserve all existing UI/UX patterns while adding enterprise features through composition and higher-order components. Maintains user familiarity while adding enterprise capabilities.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete rewrite (rejected - unnecessary risk and development time)
- Parallel implementation (rejected - creates maintenance burden)
- Feature flags for gradual rollout (considered and recommended for deployment)

## Audit Logging Implementation

### Decision: SharePoint Audit Logs + Custom Application Logging
**Rationale**: SharePoint provides built-in audit logging for data changes. Custom application logging captures user interactions and business logic events, stored in separate SharePoint list.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Azure Application Insights only (rejected - lacks business context)
- Third-party logging service (rejected - enterprise prefers Microsoft stack)
- Database audit triggers (N/A - using SharePoint not custom database)

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Vitest + React Testing Library + Microsoft Graph SDK Mocks
**Rationale**: Vitest provides fast unit testing with TypeScript support. React Testing Library enables component testing. Microsoft Graph SDK mocks allow testing without live Microsoft 365 dependencies.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest testing framework (considered but Vitest faster and more modern)
- Cypress for E2E testing (considered alongside Playwright)
- Live Microsoft 365 test tenant (rejected - flaky and slow for unit tests)

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: React Query for Microsoft Graph Caching + Component Lazy Loading
**Rationale**: React Query (TanStack Query) provides intelligent caching, background updates, and offline support for Microsoft Graph API calls. Lazy loading maintains performance budgets.

**Alternatives considered**:
- SWR caching library (considered but React Query has better TypeScript support)
- Redux for state management (rejected - React Query sufficient for API state)
- Service worker caching (considered for future enhancement)

## Security Implementation

### Decision: Microsoft Graph Permissions + CSP Headers + Input Validation
**Rationale**: Microsoft Graph permissions provide fine-grained access control. Content Security Policy headers prevent XSS attacks. Zod validation ensures type-safe input handling.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom permission system (rejected - leverage Microsoft 365 built-in security)
- Server-side validation only (rejected - client-side validation improves UX)
- JWT token validation (N/A - MSAL handles token validation)

## Migration Deployment Strategy

### Decision: Feature Flag Gradual Rollout with Parallel Running
**Rationale**: Deploy enterprise version alongside prototype with feature flags controlling access. Enables safe migration with rollback capabilities and user feedback collection.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Big bang deployment (rejected - high risk for enterprise)
- Blue-green deployment (considered but feature flags more granular)
- Canary deployment (considered and may be combined with feature flags)
