# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Enterprise Employee Announcement Tool

**Branch**: `003-enhanced-enterprise-employee` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-enhanced-enterprise-employee/spec.md`

## Summary
Transform existing React prototype Employee Announcement Tool into enterprise-ready application with Microsoft 365 integration while preserving all existing UI/UX patterns and business logic. Add corporate controls including Active Directory authentication, approval workflows, audit logging, and enterprise data persistence.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8+ with React 18.3+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Microsoft Graph SDK, @azure/msal-react, React Hook Form 7.61+, Zod 3.25+, TanStack Query 5.83+  
**Storage**: SharePoint Lists/Libraries with Microsoft Graph API integration  
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E, Microsoft Graph SDK mocking  
**Target Platform**: Web application (SharePoint Framework or standalone with Microsoft 365 integration)  
**Project Type**: Web application with Microsoft 365 backend integration  
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load, <2s user interactions, <5s time to interactive  
**Constraints**: Microsoft 365 tenant requirements, SharePoint storage limits, Graph API rate limits  
**Scale/Scope**: 500 concurrent users, enterprise-scale email distribution, audit compliance requirements

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**User-Centric Design**: ✅ Preserve all existing UI/UX patterns while adding enterprise features seamlessly
**Component Composability**: ✅ Extend existing component library with Microsoft 365 integration components  
**Type Safety**: ✅ Microsoft Graph SDK provides strict TypeScript definitions for all APIs
**Accessibility First**: ✅ Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through existing Radix UI foundation
**Performance by Design**: ✅ Performance budgets maintained with lazy loading and Graph API optimization

**Structure Decision**: Web application with frontend-only architecture leveraging Microsoft 365 backend services (SharePoint, Graph API, Teams). No custom backend server required due to comprehensive Microsoft 365 integration capabilities.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data model, Microsoft Graph contracts, quickstart scenarios)
- Each SharePoint list → setup and configuration task [P]
- Each Microsoft Graph API contract → integration test task [P]
- Each UI component → enhancement task with enterprise features
- Migration tasks to transform prototype components
- Security and audit implementation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Infrastructure first: Azure AD setup, SharePoint configuration
- Core services: Microsoft Graph integration, authentication
- UI enhancements: Add enterprise features to existing components
- Integration: Approval workflows, audit logging
- Testing and validation: Security, performance, compliance

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- Azure AD and SharePoint setup (5 tasks)
- Microsoft Graph SDK integration (8 tasks)  
- UI component enhancement (12 tasks)
- Approval workflow implementation (6 tasks)
- Audit and security features (8 tasks)
- Testing and deployment (6 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance and security validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - all principles maintained*
