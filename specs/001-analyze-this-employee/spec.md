# Feature Specification: Employee Announcement Tool Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-analyze-this-employee`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Analyze this Employee Announcement Tool application and extract comprehensive specifications including: - All communication types and their required fields - Business rules for validation - User workflows and interactions - Current technical implementation - Data storage and persistence approach"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
HR administrators need to create and send professional announcements to employees across different organizational levels (all staff, departments, teams) with appropriate tone and required compliance information based on the type of communication being sent.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an HR administrator is logged into the system, **When** they select "Policy Update" as communication type, **Then** they must provide policy name and effective date before sending
2. **Given** an HR administrator fills all required fields for a team announcement, **When** they click "Send Announcement", **Then** the system displays success confirmation and resets the form
3. **Given** an HR administrator attempts to send an announcement with missing required fields, **When** they click "Send Announcement", **Then** the system displays specific validation errors listing missing fields
4. **Given** an HR administrator selects a communication tone, **When** they preview the announcement, **Then** the preview displays appropriate styling and tone-specific prefix text
5. **Given** an HR administrator completes an announcement, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the announcement is formatted with proper sender attribution (HR department) and timestamp

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to send an announcement without selecting a communication type?
- How does the system handle extremely long announcement titles or messages?
- What occurs if a user navigates away mid-creation without saving?
- How are date validations handled for effective dates and enrollment deadlines?
