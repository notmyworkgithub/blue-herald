# Blue Herald Communication Tool Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST prioritize user experience over technical convenience. UI components MUST be intuitive, accessible, and provide clear feedback for all user actions. Communication tools MUST reduce cognitive load and enable efficient information sharing. All user flows MUST be tested with actual usage scenarios before implementation.

**Rationale**: Communication tools serve people under time pressure who need to quickly convey important information. Poor UX directly impacts business communication effectiveness.

### II. Component Composability
All UI components MUST be reusable, self-contained, and follow single responsibility principle. Components MUST accept props for customization without internal coupling. Shared components MUST reside in `/components/ui/` with clear documentation. No component dependencies beyond immediate parent-child relationships.

**Rationale**: Ensures maintainable, scalable UI architecture that supports rapid feature development and consistent design language.

### III. Type Safety (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All TypeScript code MUST compile without `any` types or type assertions except in documented edge cases. API contracts MUST be typed with Zod or similar validation. Props interfaces MUST be explicit and documented. Configuration objects MUST have strict typing.

**Rationale**: Communication tools handle sensitive organizational data. Type safety prevents runtime errors that could disrupt critical business communications.

### IV. Accessibility First
All interactive elements MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Screen readers MUST be able to navigate all features. Keyboard navigation MUST be supported throughout. Color MUST NOT be the only means of conveying information. Focus management MUST be explicit and logical.

**Rationale**: Communication tools serve diverse user populations. Accessibility ensures organizational inclusivity and may be legally required.

### V. Performance by Design
Initial page load MUST complete under 3 seconds on 3G networks. Time to interactive MUST be under 5 seconds. Bundle size increases MUST be justified with user value. Images MUST be optimized and appropriately sized. Lazy loading MUST be implemented for non-critical components.

**Rationale**: Communication urgency requires immediate tool availability. Poor performance impedes time-sensitive business communications.

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- Component tests MUST cover all user interactions
- Integration tests MUST validate complete user workflows
- Accessibility tests MUST be automated in CI/CD
- Performance budgets MUST be enforced in builds
- Visual regression tests MUST catch design system violations

### Code Quality
- ESLint MUST pass with zero warnings
- Prettier MUST be enforced for consistent formatting
- No unused imports or variables allowed
- Function complexity MUST stay below 10 cyclomatic complexity
- Files MUST not exceed 200 lines (components) or 100 lines (utilities)

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Design review MUST approve user experience before implementation
2. Component API MUST be designed and reviewed before coding
3. Tests MUST be written before implementation (TDD)
4. Accessibility review MUST occur before feature completion
5. Performance impact MUST be measured and documented

### Code Review
- All PRs MUST pass automated quality gates
- Designer MUST approve UI/UX changes
- Type safety MUST be verified by reviewer
- Performance impact MUST be assessed for bundle size changes
- Accessibility compliance MUST be manually verified

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with documented business necessity and approved by project leads.

For runtime development guidance and tool-specific instructions, refer to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or equivalent agent guidance files.
